# F1 Archive Catalog

An open-source, community-maintained catalog of what Formula 1 race content is available on F1TV's archive, organized by region.

## Why

F1TV's archive varies by region and content type. Some races have full replays, others only have extended highlights or appear in a season review. There's no public API for this information. This repo is a structured, machine-readable reference you can join to [`calendar/f1-all-time-race-list.json`](calendar/f1-all-time-race-list.json) on `season` + `round`.

## Schema

Each region file is a flat JSON array. Every entry represents one watchable item on F1TV.

```json
{
  "season": 2017,
  "round": 1,
  "name": "Australian Grand Prix",
  "type": "race",
  "duration": "02:04:30",
  "url": "https://f1tv.formula1.com/detail/1000002299/2017-australian-grand-prix"
}
```

### Fields

- **`season`** (integer) — Championship year. Must match the race calendar.
- **`round`** (integer | null) — Official FIA championship round number. **Required** for race-bound content (`race`, `extended_highlights`, `highlights`). Only `season-review` may use `null`. Round numbers may have gaps when a scheduled race was cancelled (e.g. 2023 has no round 6 — Emilia Romagna). Sourced from [`calendar/f1-all-time-race-list.json`](calendar/f1-all-time-race-list.json), not F1TV's UI badges.
- **`name`** (string) — Display label from F1TV (not used for joining).
- **`type`** (string) — Content type. One of:
  - `"race"` — Full race replay
  - `"extended_highlights"` — Extended highlights (~25–30 min)
  - `"highlights"` — Short highlights (~5–10 min)
  - `"season-review"` — Season review / recap
- **`duration`** (string | null) — Runtime in `HH:MM:SS` format. `null` if unknown.
- **`url`** (string) — F1TV deep link. Prefer `/detail/...` watch URLs over `/page/...` hub URLs when both exist.

### Uniqueness

Each entry is uniquely identified by:

- **`(season, round, type)`** for round-bound content
- **`(season, type)`** when `round` is `null` (season reviews only)

A single race may have **multiple entries** — e.g. full replay, extended highlights, and short highlights each get their own row with its own `url`.

### Season-level content

For seasons where individual races aren't available but a season review exists:

```json
{
  "season": 1985,
  "round": null,
  "name": "1985 Season Review",
  "type": "season-review",
  "duration": "01:20:00",
  "url": "https://f1tv.formula1.com/detail/..."
}
```

## Viewer

Browse the catalog in your browser:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open [http://localhost:8080/viewer/](http://localhost:8080/viewer/). You can also use the file picker on that page to load `f1-tv-archive-catalogs-by-region/US-f1-tv-archive-catalog.json` directly.

## Calendar

Official FIA race calendar used for round assignment and validation:

- [`calendar/f1-all-time-race-list.json`](calendar/f1-all-time-race-list.json) — championship races by `season` + `round` (gaps allowed for cancelled races)

## Regions

Each region has its own file under `f1-tv-archive-catalogs-by-region/`:

- `f1-tv-archive-catalogs-by-region/US-f1-tv-archive-catalog.json` — United States

More regions welcome via PR.

## Scraping

See **[scraper/README.md](scraper/README.md)** for full setup. You need [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) and Python 3.

```bash
python3 scraper/scraper_server.py
```

Then install `scraper/f1tv-scraper.user.js` in Tampermonkey and scrape pages on f1tv.formula1.com.

### Post-processing

```bash
python3 scripts/clean_catalog.py f1-tv-archive-catalogs-by-region/US-f1-tv-archive-catalog.json
python3 scripts/enrich_rounds.py f1-tv-archive-catalogs-by-region/US-f1-tv-archive-catalog.json --reconcile --fix-names
python3 scripts/validate.py f1-tv-archive-catalogs-by-region/US-f1-tv-archive-catalog.json
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Add or update entries in the appropriate region file
3. Run `python3 scripts/validate.py f1-tv-archive-catalogs-by-region/US-f1-tv-archive-catalog.json`
4. Open a PR with a brief description of what changed

Durations can be added incrementally — `null` is fine as a placeholder. `url` should be present for all new entries.
